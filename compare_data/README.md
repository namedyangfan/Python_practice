# compare_gw

HGS generate observation well output provides measurements like head, soil moisture, and elevation for 
each simulation time step in block format. The purpose of this script is to post process the data into
column format and perform transformation including:
*convert head to depth
*convert simulation time to real time
*average data on weekly average
		
## Usage

* read_raw_obs: read hgs observation well output (block format)

* reorder_raw2column: convert bloc format to column format

* head_to_depth: convert head to depth from surface elevation

* to_realtime: convert simulation time (in seconds) to ISO time 

* avg_weekly: averge all the columns on ISO calender week

* op: output the processed data as CSV format

# Method

## *class* compare_gw( *file_directory, file_name* )
file_directory: directory of the *.observation_well_flow.* file.
file_name: *.observation_well_flow.* file name 
```
Obs_well_hgs( file_directory = file_directory, file_name='ARB_QUAPo.observation_well_flow.Baildon059.dat')
```

## compare_gw.**read_raw_obs()**
read the *.observation_well_flow.* file generated by HGS.

## compare_gw.**reorder_raw2column(*var_names = ['H', 'S', 'Z'], start_sheet = None, end_sheet = None*)**
	var_names: a list of variables read from the *.observation_well_flow.* file. The default read *H*,*S*, and *Z*.
	start_sheet/end_sheet: HGS models usually have multiple sheets. The variables from *start_sheet* to *end_sheet* are extracted. 
	Note: the layer numbering in HGS counts from the botom. Sheet 1 means bottom layer.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
